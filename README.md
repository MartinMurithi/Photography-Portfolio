## Photography Portfolio

Welcome to Roy's photography portfolio! This project showcases his photography work using React JS and CSS3 for styling. I've also integrated features like email sending using Email JS, navigation using React Router DOM, and toast notifications using Hot Toast.

## Features

- **React JS**: The project is built using React JS, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **CSS3 Styling**: CSS3 is used for styling to enhance the visual appeal of the portfolio.
- **Email JS Integration**: Users can easily contact him through the website using the Email JS integration.
- **React Router DOM**: Navigation within the website is seamless thanks to React Router DOM.
- **Hot Toast Notifications**: Toast notifications are implemented using Hot Toast to provide feedback to users.

## Image Loading Optimization

To ensure fast loading times and avoid empty spaces when the page loads, we've used placeholder images that are less than 1kb in size. This optimization technique helps maintain a smooth user experience without sacrificing visual appeal.

## Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive, thanks to media queries. It looks great and functions well on various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent experience for all users.
